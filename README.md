# 🔍 Autocomplete Search Bar using Trie

This project is a simple and efficient **Autocomplete Search Bar** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and the **Trie (Prefix Tree)** data structure. It provides real-time word suggestions as you type, mimicking the behavior of modern search engines and input fields.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time search suggestions
- Trie data structure implementation in JavaScript
- Efficient prefix-based lookup
- Responsive and clean UI
- Easy to customize and extend

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A predefined list of words is inserted into a **Trie**.
2. As the user types a prefix into the input field, the app searches the Trie for all words that begin with that prefix.
3. Matching results are displayed instantly below the input box using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – structure of the app
- **CSS** – styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** – core logic and DOM interaction
- **Trie** – used for fast and efficient prefix searches
